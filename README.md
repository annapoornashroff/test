## 🔐 Authentication Architecture

### Firebase Authentication Integration

We have implemented **Firebase Authentication** for secure, scalable phone number-based authentication following industry best practices:

#### **Why Firebase Authentication?**
- **Security**: Industry-leading security with built-in protection against common attacks
- **Scalability**: Handles millions of users without infrastructure concerns
- **Reliability**: 99.95% uptime SLA with global infrastructure
- **Compliance**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, and other security certifications
- **Phone Verification**: Robust SMS-based OTP system with fraud protection
- **Multi-platform**: Consistent authentication across web, mobile, and backend

#### **Security Features Implemented**
- **reCAPTCHA Protection**: Prevents automated abuse and bot attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against brute force attacks
- **Token Validation**: Secure JWT tokens with automatic refresh
- **Phone Number Verification**: SMS-based OTP with international support
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic cleanup
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All authentication traffic encrypted in transit

#### **Authentication Flow**
1. **Phone Number Entry**: User enters Indian mobile number (+91 format)
2. **reCAPTCHA Verification**: Invisible reCAPTCHA prevents abuse
3. **SMS OTP Delivery**: Firebase sends 6-digit OTP via SMS
4. **OTP Verification**: User enters OTP for verification
5. **Firebase Token**: Firebase generates secure ID token
6. **Backend Integration**: Token verified and user profile created/updated
7. **Session Management**: Secure session established with auto-refresh

#### **Implementation Details**
- **Frontend**: React hooks with Firebase SDK integration
- **Backend**: Firebase Admin SDK for token verification
- **Database**: User profiles stored in PostgreSQL with Firebase UID mapping
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States**: Smooth UX with loading indicators and progress feedback

## 🔧 Dependency Management & Architecture Decisions

### ✅ REMOVED DEPENDENCIES (Simplified Architecture)

#### **Redis Removal**
- **Reason**: Firebase handles authentication state and session management
- **Replaced with**: Firebase Authentication built-in session handling
- **Benefits**: Reduced infrastructure complexity, better security, automatic scaling

#### **AWS S3 Removal**
- **Reason**: Not currently used in the application
- **Status**: Removed until file upload features are needed
- **Future**: Can be re-added when implementing vendor portfolio uploads

#### **SendGrid Removal**
- **Reason**: Replaced with Gmail SMTP for simplicity
- **Replaced with**: Gmail SMTP using App Passwords
- **Benefits**: No external service dependency, easier setup for development

#### **Twilio Removal**
- **Reason**: Firebase handles SMS OTP delivery
- **Replaced with**: Firebase Phone Authentication
- **Benefits**: Integrated solution, better fraud protection, global SMS delivery

### 📧 Email Configuration (Gmail SMTP)

Instead of SendGrid, we now use Gmail SMTP for email notifications:

#### **Setup Instructions**
1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
3. **Environment Variables**:
   ```env
   GMAIL_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
Features
Wedding invitation emails
Guest RSVP notifications
Booking confirmations
HTML email templates with branding
