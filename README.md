## 🔐 Authentication Architecture

### Firebase Authentication Integration

We have implemented **Firebase Authentication** for secure, scalable phone number-based authentication following industry best practices:

#### **Why Firebase Authentication?**
- **Security**: Industry-leading security with built-in protection against common attacks
- **Scalability**: Handles millions of users without infrastructure concerns
- **Reliability**: 99.95% uptime SLA with global infrastructure
- **Compliance**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, and other security certifications
- **Phone Verification**: Robust SMS-based OTP system with fraud protection
- **Multi-platform**: Consistent authentication across web, mobile, and backend

#### **Security Features Implemented**
- **reCAPTCHA Protection**: Prevents automated abuse and bot attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against brute force attacks
- **Token Validation**: Secure JWT tokens with automatic refresh
- **Phone Number Verification**: SMS-based OTP with international support
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic cleanup
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All authentication traffic encrypted in transit

#### **Authentication Flow**
1. **Phone Number Entry**: User enters Indian mobile number (+91 format)
2. **reCAPTCHA Verification**: Invisible reCAPTCHA prevents abuse
3. **SMS OTP Delivery**: Firebase sends 6-digit OTP via SMS
4. **OTP Verification**: User enters OTP for verification
5. **Firebase Token**: Firebase generates secure ID token
6. **Backend Integration**: Token verified and user profile created/updated
7. **Session Management**: Secure session established with auto-refresh

#### **Implementation Details**
- **Frontend**: React hooks with Firebase SDK integration
- **Backend**: Firebase Admin SDK for token verification
- **Database**: User profiles stored in PostgreSQL with Firebase UID mapping
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States**: Smooth UX with loading indicators and progress feedback

## Progress Update: Type Consolidation and Refactor

### Completed Tasks
- **Consolidated Types/Interfaces:**
  - Moved all UI/component and shared domain types/interfaces into `lib/types/ui.ts`.
  - Ensured all components and pages import their types from this common file.
  - API-specific types remain in `lib/types/api.ts` for separation of concerns.
- **Removed Duplicates:**
  - Removed local type/interface definitions from components/pages.
  - Resolved all linter/type errors that arose from the migration.
- **Prop Name Consistency:**
  - Fixed a prop name mismatch for `GoogleReviewsBadge` (`reviewCount` → `totalReviews`).
- **Linter/Type Safety:**
  - All components/pages now use the correct, centralized types and pass type-checking.

### Next Steps / TODO
- Review for any missed or edge-case types/interfaces.
- Consider further splitting types by domain or feature if the codebase grows.
- Continue to update the common types file as new components or features are added.
